# ðŸ“‚ python-generators-0x00

## ðŸ“– Overview

This folder contains the first module in the **Advanced Python Generators** project. It introduces practical applications of Pythonâ€™s `yield` keyword for building memory-efficient, high-performance data workflows. The exercises in this module focus on foundational and intermediate generator concepts applied to real-world-style tasks.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

By working through the materials in `python-generators-0x00`, you will:

* **Master Python Generators**
  Understand how to implement and use generator functions and expressions to efficiently process data.

* **Batch & Lazy Data Handling**
  Create generators for batch processing and lazy loading, essential for working with large datasets.

* **Simulate Live Data Updates**
  Build systems that mimic live or streaming data feeds using generator-based logic.

* **Optimize with Aggregations**
  Use generators to compute aggregations (e.g., averages, sums) on-the-fly with minimal memory usage.

* **Integrate SQL for Dynamic Data**
  Combine Python with SQL queries to retrieve and iterate over data without loading entire datasets into memory.

## ðŸ§° Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following knowledge before starting:

* Python 3.x proficiency
* Solid grasp of `yield`, generator functions, and iterator protocol
* Basic experience with MySQL or SQLite
* Understanding of database schema design and seeding
* Git and GitHub usage for version control

## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. Navigate to the folder:

   ```bash
   cd python-generators-0x00
   ```

2. (Optional) Set up a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install any required dependencies if present:
